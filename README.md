# Contest solutions

Solutions to contest (algorithm contests) problems (Single Round Matches or SRMs) from [TopCoder](topcoder.com).

I plan on updating this repo with more solutions. This is known as `upsolving` in the competitive programming community.

Directories are SRM numbers. The file names in each directory are the problem codes.
